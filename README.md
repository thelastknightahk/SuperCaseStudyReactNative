                                                SuperCaseStudy


Overview
   SuperCaseStudy is a React Native application designed to demonstrate a leaderboard UI with advanced features, such as sorting, filtering, and searching for users. It uses Redux for state management and integrates libraries for enhanced user interactions, such as haptic feedback.

The application allows users to:

   View a leaderboard of top-ranked users.
   Search for specific users by name.
   Sort users alphabetically or by ranking.
   Display the lowest-ranked users.
   View detailed user information in a modal dialog.
